/* I made the styles for this bland and basic so I could see the differences I know it didnt call for a lot of css but in the instructions it did say "â€¢ Create a nice look and feel for the user." also I also wanted to make note Im having trouble doing the comments after every line I have lupus and its hit and miss which days its going to effect my cognitive functions and I have a hard time following my own code with comments in between so i hope its ok if I do blocks  */

since a is a link it makes sense that you use text-decoration on sidebar links to remove the default underline and color blue so I did that so I could add a hover effect later.
